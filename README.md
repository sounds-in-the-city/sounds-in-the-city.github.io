## Updating Content

#### Things to keep in mind: 
The basic structure of the .yml files you will edit to update your site's content is a map or list and follows a hierarchy that depends on indentation see example below: 

Maps allow you to associate key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, and the order doesn't matter. A list includes values listed in a specific order and may contain any number of items needed. A list sequence starts with a dash (-) and a space, while indentation separates it from the parent.

In the example below "fruits" and "vegetables" are items that are part of the list named "food". "citrics", "tropics", "nuts", "sweets" are items that belong to the "fruits" list item. 

```
food: 
  - vegetables: tomatoes
  - fruits: 
      citrics: oranges 
      tropical: bananas
      nuts: peanuts
      sweets: raisins
```
