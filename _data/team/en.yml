      info: "Christopher Trudeau is a sound and noise researcher with an interest in the social inequalities in long-term sonic environments, as well as popular attitudes toward urban noise. He’s been with the Sounds in the City team since 2017 working on projects that deal with sound-related issues in urban design (Fleurs de Macadam; Plateau-Mont-Royal) and the cohabitation between activities (ÉcoutezMTL; Downtown Montreal)."
    - name: "Richard Yanaky"
      role: "Researcher"
      image: "/assets/images/team/Rectangular/richard2_small.jpg"
      info: "Richard Yanaky is helping professionals by leading the research and development of a new immersive sound planning tool, City Ditty. City Ditty aims to introduce a new generation of professionals to soundscape design by helping raise their sound-awareness, teach them soundscape design principles, and support them in the creation of their own soundscapes in a fully navigable and immersive 3D environment via Virtual Reality or desktop PC. He hopes that through empowering more people through simple-to-use technology, more people will be able to contribute to creating healthier and enjoyable cities. City soundscapes are complex but talking about them needn’t be! This work is supported by Richard’s mixed background in information studies, computer science, psycholinguistics, and many years as a college and university instructor."
