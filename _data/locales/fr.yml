  description: "Le sonore joue un rôle essentiel et complexe dans notre expérience des espaces urbains. 
  À l’heure actuelle, la majorité des villes considèrent les enjeux sonores comme du “bruit”, c’est-à-dire une nuisance n’existant qu’en vase clos et considérée uniquement au moment 
  où des problèmes surgissent. Mais tout n’est pas qu’une question de bruit ! Le sonore contribue à notre bien-être, nous aide à nous orienter dans le temps et l’espace, peut animer nos milieux de vie et les rendre plus attrayants. Plus encore, les ambiances sonores font partie intégrante du patrimoine de nos villes. 
  Pensez notamment aux sonorités de votre quotidien, comme la musique, les conversations, les chants des oiseaux ou les cloches."

      id: "home-accordion-1"
      description: "Ville Sonore est un partenariat mené par Pr. Guastavino qui réunit chercheur·ses, artistes, professionel·les qui façonnent nos villes, et citoyen·nes pour discuter du sonore comme ressource et nourrir des solutions créatives visant à rendre nos villes plus agréables à vivre."

    - title: AMBIANCES SONORES
      id: "home-accordion-2"
      description: "Le concept d’ambiance sonore (aussi connu sous le nom de paysage sonore) [LIEN PAGE SOUNDSCAPE] est une approche novatrice, centrée sur le ressenti, qui redéfinit le sonore comme ressource en lien avec les autres dimensions de l’aménagement urbain, des premiers stades de la conception aux usages dans la durée. Au cœur de cette approche se trouve l’idée que les sonorités du quotidien ne sont pas toutes (et toujours) indésirables. Cependant, malgré de grandes avancées dans le domaine de la recherche, le paysage sonore peine à être mis en œuvre dans la pratique. En somme, tout·e citoyen·ne a le droit de vivre, travailler et se relaxer dans des ambiances sonores qu’iel juge appropriées. Pour y arriver, il faut prendre en compte les perspectives citoyennes, notamment les activités menées et les contextes dans lesquels sont vécus les expériences sonores – tout cela, dans le but de mieux planifier et aménager nos espaces urbains. À terme, nous pouvons améliorer la qualité de vie des résidents et des visiteurs de nos villes par le biais d’une meilleure gestion urbaine sensible au sonore."

Dans l’élan des chantiers réglementaires au Québec et au Canada, nous avons mis en place un partenariat intersectoriel pour contribuer à une fabrique de la ville plus équitable, favorable à la santé, et sensible au sonore."

  title: Why sound matters?
  description: Often described as the “new secondhand smoke”, <strong>noise is a major pollutant</strong> of our time, with consequences ranging from annoyance and hearing loss to early death. Poor noise management also has environmental consequences as precious resources and space are wasted.

    description:
      "In Quebec alone, 1 out 5 people is highly annoyed with noise and the
      cost of noise is estimated at 871 M$ per year. Large cities are
      particularly prone to conflicts around unwanted sounds due to increased
      densification, mixed uses, diverse economies, and nightlife.
      <strong> Yet, not all sound is noise.</strong> Many sound-producing
      activities contribute to
      <strong> vitality and attractiveness of cities,</strong> including
      transportation, tourism, leisure, outdoor festivals and other cultural
      events. "

    title: "NOISE"
    subheading: "positive sounds"
    description: "However, guidelines and policies rely almost exclusively on <strong>sound levels</strong> (in decibels), which, alone, fails to capture the complexity of people’s diverse <strong>experiences of urban sounds.</strong> "
    info: "A pocket park in the summer"
    banner_url: "/assets/images/sound-matters/2.png"

  footer_descscription:
    "This complexity includes positive outcomes of sound (well-being,
    orientation, and community-building), the variety of stakeholders involved
    (across disciplines, sectors, communities and levels of government), and,
    critically, the social underpinnings of noise. <br><br>
    This is particularly true in Canada, where city-makers consider sound as
    an afterthought, if at all, through corrective measures when people submit
    complaints. Not only is this noise control strategy too little and too
    late, it also fails to build fairness into our cities. Indeed minoritized
    communities are subject to more stringent policing, and more likely to be
    exposed to higher noise levels."
