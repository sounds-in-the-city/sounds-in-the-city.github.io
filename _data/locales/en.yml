  notbad: "(not just less bad)"
  description: "Sound plays a critical and complex role in the way we experience urban spaces.
  Today, most cities treat urban sound as “noise”, an isolated nuisance that should be mitigated when problems arise.
  But sound is more than just noise! Sound can also support our well-being, orientation in time and space, focus,
  and our lasting memories of urban spaces - even the city as a whole.
  Think about the sounds of your daily life, such as music, conversation, bird chirping, or bells."

      id: "home-accordion-1"
      description: "Sounds in the City, led by Prof. Guastavino, brings together researchers, artists, professionals who shape our cities, and citizens, to look at urban sound from a novel, resource-oriented perspective and nourish creative solutions to make cities sound better. "

    - title: SOUNDSCAPE
      id: "home-accordion-2"
      description: "<a href=\"./soundscape\">Soundscape</a> is a new user-centered proactive approach reframing sound as a resource, in relation to other urban design considerations, from early conception to long-term use. It does away with the implicit assumption that all environmental sounds are unwanted. While soundscape has become well established in research, implementation in practice remains scarce. Ultimately, every city user deserves to live, work, play and relax in sound environments they find appropriate. Realizing this goal involves accounting for “city users” perspectives, their activities, and the contexts in which sounds are experienced, all of which has implications for how “city makers” plan and design urban spaces. In the long run, we can improve the quality of life of residents and visitors who will benefit from a better-managed city, where sound has been considered as part of their experience."

      description: "Sounds in the City uses Montreal as a living laboratory for soundscape research in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders from the private and public sectors, as well as the general public. Building on momentum to revisit noise policies in Canada and Quebec, we have assembled a cross-sectorial partnership to inform more equitable, sound-aware and healthier city-making."

  description: Often described as the “new secondhand smoke”, <strong>noise is a major pollutant</strong> of our time, with consequences ranging from annoyance and hearing loss to early death. Poor noise management also has environmental consequences as precious resources and space are wasted.

    description:
      "In Quebec alone, 1 out 5 people is highly annoyed with noise and the
      cost of noise is estimated at 871 M$ per year. Large cities are
      particularly prone to conflicts around unwanted sounds due to increased
      densification, mixed uses, diverse economies, and nightlife.
      <strong> Yet, not all sound is noise.</strong> Many sound-producing
      activities contribute to
      <strong> vitality and attractiveness of cities,</strong> including
      transportation, tourism, leisure, outdoor festivals and other cultural
      events. "

    description: "However, guidelines and policies rely almost exclusively on <strong>sound levels</strong> (in decibels), which, alone, fails to capture the complexity of people’s diverse <strong>experiences of urban sounds.</strong> "
    info: "A pocket park in the summer"
    banner_url: "/assets/images/sound-matters/2.png"

  footer_descscription:
    "This complexity includes positive outcomes of sound (well-being,
    orientation, and community-building), the variety of stakeholders involved
    (across disciplines, sectors, communities and levels of government), and,
    critically, the social underpinnings of noise. <br><br>
    This is particularly true in Canada, where city-makers consider sound as
    an afterthought, if at all, through corrective measures when people submit
    complaints. Not only is this noise control strategy too little and too
    late, it also fails to build fairness into our cities. Indeed minoritized
    communities are subject to more stringent policing, and more likely to be
    exposed to higher noise levels."
